# Production...ish docker-compose image for wger

ðŸš§ in construction ðŸš§


## Usage

This docker-compose file starts up a production environment with gunicorn
as the webserver, postgres as a database and redis for caching with nginx
used as a reverse proxy.

The database, static files and uploaded images are mounted as volumes so
the data is persisted. The only thing you need to do is update the images.

### 1 - Start all services

To start all services:

    docker-compose up

Then open <http://localhost> (or your server IP) and log in as: **admin**,
password **admin**


### 2 - Lifecycle Management

To stop all services issue a stop command, this will preserve all containers
and volumes:

    docker-compose stop

To start everything up again:

    docker-compose start

To remove all containers (except for the volumes)

    docker-compose down

To view the logs:

    docker-compose logs -f

### 3 - Other commands

You might need to issue other commands or do other manual work in the container,
e.g.

     docker-compose exec web yarn install
     docker-compose exec --user root web /bin/bash


## Building

If you want to build the images yourself, clone the wger repository and follow
the instructions for the appropriate images in the extras/docker folder.
